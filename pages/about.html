            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>  
                G-Mash Garage was founded in response to the growing need for reliable, transparent, and
                affordable automotive services in South Africa. Many car owners struggle with inconsistent service 
                quality, hidden costs, and a lack of trust in traditional repair shops. G-Mash Garage aims to bridge
                this gap by offering a modern, customer-first approach to car maintenance and repair.
                Our garage not only provides routine services like oil changes, brake repairs, and tyre replacements
                but also specializes in advanced diagnostics, engine work, and premium detailing. By leveraging the latest tools
                and technology, G-Mash Garage ensures every vehicle receives precise and efficient care.
                Unlike many garages that operate with a transactional mindset, G-Mash Garage is built on relationships. 
                We want customers to feel confident about their vehicles and educated about the services they receive. Our team of
                certified mechanics and technicians is dedicated to creating a stress-free experience, whether you're in for a quick check-up
                or a full repair.
                Over time, G-Mash Garage aspires to expand into multiple branches, becoming a household name associated with trust, expertise,
                and innovation in the automotive industry.

                and beyond. We aspire to be recognised not only for our technical expertise but also for our customer-first
