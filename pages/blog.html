            <p>
                Owning a car is a big responsibility, and proper maintenance is the key to keeping your vehicle safe, reliable, and running smoothly for years. 
                At <strong>G-Mash Garage</strong>, we believe that well-informed car owners save money and avoid unnecessary breakdowns. 
                That’s why we’ve put together this detailed guide with our <strong>Top 7 Car Maintenance Tips Every Driver Should Know</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Regular Oil Changes</h2>
            <p>
                Oil is the lifeblood of your engine. Without fresh, clean oil, your engine can suffer from excess friction, overheating, and premature wear. 
                Most manufacturers recommend an oil change every <strong>5,000 – 10,000 km</strong>, depending on the type of oil and driving conditions. 
                At G-Mash Garage, we use high-quality oil that maximises engine performance and extends its life.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Check Your Tyres</h2>
            <p>
                Your tyres are your only contact with the road, so keeping them in top shape is vital. 
                Make sure to check <strong>tyre pressure</strong> at least once a month, and rotate your tyres every 10,000 km. 
                Don’t forget to inspect tread depth – worn-out tyres can be dangerous, especially in wet conditions.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Replace Brake Pads on Time</h2>
            <p>
                Brakes are critical for safety. Worn-out brake pads not only reduce stopping power but can also damage your rotors, leading to more costly repairs. 
                If you hear squeaking or grinding sounds when braking, it’s time for a check-up. Our certified technicians at G-Mash Garage can quickly diagnose and replace worn pads.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Keep Your Battery Healthy</h2>
            <p>
                A dead battery is one of the most common reasons drivers get stranded. To avoid this, check your battery’s charge regularly and clean off any corrosion on the terminals. 
                Most car batteries last between <strong>3 to 5 years</strong>. If your headlights are dimming or your car struggles to start, book a battery test with us.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Stay on Top of Fluid Levels</h2>
            <p>
                Your car relies on more than just engine oil. Other critical fluids include transmission fluid, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and coolant. 
                Low or dirty fluids can cause expensive damage if ignored. During every service at G-Mash Garage, we inspect and top up all essential fluids to keep your car running smoothly.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Don’t Ignore Warning Lights</h2>
            <p>
                Modern cars are equipped with onboard diagnostic systems. If your dashboard lights up with a warning symbol, don’t ignore it. 
                It could be something minor like a loose fuel cap, or something serious like engine trouble. 
                At our garage, we use advanced diagnostic tools to quickly identify and fix the issue.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Regular Professional Check-Ups</h2>
            <p>
                While DIY checks are great, nothing replaces a full professional inspection. 
                Scheduling a service every 6 months ensures that small issues are spotted before they turn into costly repairs. 
                At G-Mash Garage, our expert team provides a <strong>comprehensive vehicle health check</strong> covering everything from tyres and brakes to suspension and electronics.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
        Car maintenance doesn’t have to be stressful. With regular care and the right professionals by your side, your car can serve you reliably for years.
